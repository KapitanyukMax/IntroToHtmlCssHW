    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>
        A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>

    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>ax + b = 0</samp>
    </center>

    <p>
        where <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are real numbers and <var>x</var> is a variable. This form is sometimes
        called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form.
        Also, the variable may or may not be an <var>x</var> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <var>x</var>
        there.
    </p>

    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

    <p>
        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>

    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</samp>
    </center>

    <p>
        where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> are known values and <var>x</var> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <var>a</var> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

    <p>
        <var>&pi;</var> (Pi) times the radius (<var>r</var>) squared:
    </p>

    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></samp>
    </center>

    <p>
        or, when you know the diameter (<var>D</var>):
    </p>

    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></samp>
    </center>

    <p>
        or, when you know the circumference (<var>C</var>):
    </p>
    
    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</samp>
    </center>

    <h2>Intersection</h2>

    <p>
        The intersection of two sets <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>

    <center class="math-container">
        <samp>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</samp>
    </center>

    <p>
        That is, <var>x</var> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <var>x</var> is both an element of <var>A</var> and an element of <var>B</var>.
